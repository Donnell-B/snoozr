# Snoozr

This is a project inspired by the original "Sleep Cycle Calculator" [Sleepyti.me](https://sleepyti.me) except with a nicer interface!

This project was built by me in 2022 and was one of my first React projects.

I'm making this available in 2025 as part of my public work / portfolio.

It is current hosted on firebase and is avaliable at [snoozr.donnellb.dev](https://snoozr.donnellb.dev)

It works by calculating sleep cycles, which are roughly 1.5hrs, and making times available.

This project was also built to be a PWA, and was built to have a high Lighthouse score and be as optimal in loading as possible.
It also has a "service worker" meaning and can be added as an "app" on mobile devices too.

### Todos

I have a few things I'd like to still do

- Migrate to Vite. This project was built when CRA was still in use. Nowadays Vite has replaced it. I'd like to update the project to use that, as well as update dependancies.
